# Day 3 - Loops & Control Flow in Python 🚀

This folder contains examples and practice problems related to **loops**, **range**, **break/continue**, **iterables**, and **control flow** in Python. These are essential for building logic and automation scripts in DevOps and backend systems.

## 🔁 Topics Covered

| # | Topic | File Name |
|---|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Print numbers from 1 to n using `while` | `print_1_to_n.py` |
| 2 | Use of `break` and `continue` in while loop | `break_continue.py` |
| 3 | `while-else` control flow | `while_else.py` |
| 4 | Using `for` loop with `range()` | `for_loop_range.py` |
| 5 | Iterating over strings and iterables | `for_over_string.py` |
| 6 | Nested loops for pattern and table | `nested_loop.py` |
| 7 | Use of `pass` statement | `pass_example.py` |
| 8 | `for-else` usage | `for_else.py` |
| 9 | Bonus: Multiplication table (2 to 10) | `bonus_multiplication_table.py` |
| 10 | Bonus: Number triangle pattern | `triangle.py` |
| 11 | Bonus: First vowel using `for-else` | `find_vowel.py` |

## ✍️ Practice Instructions

- Clone this repo or run each file in your Python environment.
- Modify the values of `n`, `i`, or user input to see how loops behave.
- Try adding your own conditions to the examples (e.g., skip even numbers, add counters, etc.)
- Add comments in your code to explain what each line is doing — it's a great habit for real projects.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- The difference between `while` and `for` loops
- How `break`, `continue`, and `pass` modify loop behavior
- How to iterate over various Python data types
- How to use `while-else` and `for-else` (lesser-known features)
